Project for the practice of Android development using a Kotlin language, design patterns, GRASP and Architectural design.

## Getting Started

Kotlin Project is an application that lists several posts, it is possible to add new posts, list them and see them in detail.

# Activities

* PostFeedActivity - Although not named as "MainActivity" this is the initial activity of the application. In it are listed the posts and also there is a button to add a new post. to list the post, I used the RecyclerView component.
* PostInputActivity - In this activity you can insert a new post or modify an existing one.
* PostDetailActivity - This activity shows individually and in detail a post.
